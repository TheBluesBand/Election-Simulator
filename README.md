# Election-Simulator
A election simulator written in C++ 11 where 3 different political parties campaign over a specified amount of days in a specified amount of  electorates. Each party has different stances on a range of different issues and so does each electorate. They may gain\lose popularity in an electorate based on random events that occur each day of the campaign which may help them lose or win the election  
## Why write this?
This was assessment 2 out of 3 I did in my advanced programming class at university which I averaged a High Distinction (+85%) which I was proud enough to put onto my GitHyb

## Environment Set Up
### Setting up for CodeBlocks:
We're assuming you have set up codeblocks with the default complier

#### Creating a project:
1. File -> New -> Project -> Empty project
2. Assign the project to a folder (Keep all .cpp and .h files in the same directory as the project file)
3. Give the project a name (I'll call it APE)
4. Make sure complier is selected to 'GNU GCC Complier' and hit finish

#### Adding the files:
Once your project is created you'll want to add the files to the program

Project -> Add Files -> Select 'main.cpp, header.h, header.cpp' -> Ok
This will add all the files into the project

#### Assigning the program argument:
To assign arguments in the command line use the steps below:
(Make sure to add all files before completing this step)
1) Select Project -> Set programs' arguments...
2) In the box labeled 'program arguments' and type in the two argument (n m)
3) Click Okay and the arguments are now set

Now you should be able to compile the program!

#### Running the Program

Click 'Build and Run' (The yellow cog and green arrow button) and a terminal should be displayed with the program.
